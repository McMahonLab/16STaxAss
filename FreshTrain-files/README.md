The FreshTrain
===

The zipped files in this folder contain the McMahon Lab's custom taxonomy database for lake epilimia, fondly referred to as *The FreshTrain* (for Freshwater Training Set). **There are 3 files inside each zipped folder:**  

1. The `.taxonomy` file is a table with sequence IDs followed by taxonomic names.   
2. The `.fasta` file lists the nucleotide sequence for each sequence ID.  
3. The readme file describes the changes in the current version of the database.

FreshTrain18Aug2016     | old version formatted for Greengenes (don't use)  
FreshTrain25Jan2018Greengenes13_5.zip | current version formatted for Greengenes  
FreshTrain30Apr2018SILVAv128.zip | current version formatted for SILVA v128  
**FreshTrain30Apr2018SILVAv132.zip** | **current version formatted for SILVA v132**  

The different formats match the FreshTrain's coarse-level nomenclature to the nomenclature in the comprehensive database of choice. The FreshTrain defines lineage-clade-tribe (~family-genus-species) level phylogenies, so the phylum, class, and order names are changed in the different FreshTrain versions to be consistent with the paired comprehensive database.
